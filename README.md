# CreditCard_Churn_Analysis-using-MachineLearning

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a dataset to extract meaningful insights. The steps include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to uncover trends and patterns.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of multiple features, including numerical and categorical variables.
- It is cleaned and processed to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

## Steps Involved
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
- Removing duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
- Converting categorical variables into numerical form (if applicable).
- Feature engineering to enhance data insights.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generating summary statistics to understand data distribution.
- Visualizing data using:
  - **Histograms & Boxplots**: For distribution analysis.
  - **Scatter Plots & Correlation Heatmaps**: To explore relationships.
  - **Bar Charts & Line Plots**: To observe trends over time.

### 3. Data Insights
- Identified key trends and patterns in the dataset.
- Observed correlations between variables to highlight significant relationships.
- Detected any anomalies or outliers that could impact further analysis.

### 4. Future Enhancements
- Application of machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Integration with real-time data sources for dynamic insights.
- Further feature engineering for improved analytics.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for data exploration
